Route Optimization for Pothole Repair is a web application that is used to assist the crew members to optimize route taken for pothole repair. Each city would have several potholes and multiple crews would be working on repairing those potholes. Each day the crew would be given a list of potholes to be repaired and the crew would head out to work on those potholes without any route optimization. This is an inefficient process, which results in wastage of time and fuel. The web application would help the crew to generate an optimized route that saves time and fuel. This optimized route will be generated using Traveling Salesman Algorithm.
